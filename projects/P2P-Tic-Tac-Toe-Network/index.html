        <p>This was my final project for my fourth year undergraduate <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/cu0607uc/courses/COMP/4104.html" target="_blank">distributed programming course</a>. There were no specific requirements for the project, only
        to create a piece of software of our choosing that encompassed most of what we learned in the course. I chose to program a Tic-Tac-Toe network where players can log on, play rounds of Tic-Tac-Toe with each other and log
        off. The program is written in Java with a Swing GUI and it uses Apache Axis for its web service implementation.
        </p>
        
        <p>I have gone back and refactored the source code since I completed the project. The source code and executables are available <a href="https://github.com/ShacharAvni/P2P-Tic-Tac-Toe" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <br /><p>Players can connect with each other either directly in peer-to-peer (P2P) style or through a "Registry" that stores other players' connection information. All Tic-Tac-Toe games play
      out in P2P fashion, no matter which connection method is used.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Registry is a web service built on the publish-subscribe architecture, where players "subscribe" to topics and the Registry "publishes" changes in these topics. The topics are
      "join" where the Registry publishes that a player has joined the network, and "leave" where the Registry publishes that a player has left the network.
      </p>
      
      <p>Each player runs their own faux web service that listens for game invitations, forfeitures, and moves. All messages are sent as SOAP.
