        <p>The goal of this project was to extend an existing algorithm for message culling in networked first person shooter style games for use in terrains. The programming work involved writing a console app in C that precomputes the
        visibility information for each quad in a quad tree decomposition of a terrain height map. I also wrote a GUI with C++, OpenGL, and GLUT that reads in the visibility information and displays the terrain. The user could place two
        people on the terrain using the mouse and then run the algorithm, with the results then displayed on the terrain in real time.

      <br /><p><b>Background:</b></p>
      
      <p>Given a pair of players in an online game, a <i><b>frontier</b></i> of one player with respect to the other is a region of the game environment where that player may move without being visible to the other player. Frontiers are generated 
      in pairs, called <i><b>frontier sets</b></i>, which define two mutually-invisible regions. The above picture shows two people on Martian terrain with their frontiers colored blue and red. Frontier set generation can be used for message culling in online games; if two 
      players are mutually-hidden then they need not communicate.
      </p>
      
      <p><b>The Algorithm:</b></p>
      
      <p>We start with a <i>Potentially Visible Set</i> (PVS) that stores the point-to-point visibility of a terrain height map. The brute force approach, which
      would involve growing regions around the players by adding points and checking if those points are hidden from every point in the other player's region, is too costly.
      </p>
      
      <p>The algorithm described in my thesis proposes to first subdivide the PVS into a quad tree. That is, using the computed point-to-point visibility information, we
      determine the visibility between all quads on the terrain at increasingly finer levels of resolution. This PVS, called a <i>hierarchical PVS</i> is constructed
      in bottom-up fashion from the finest to the coarsest quads.
      </p>
      
      <p>The algorithm includes a PVS merging operation which allows for merging the hierarchical PVS of two regions, where the merged PVS would store the quads visible
      from either region. A method to compress a hierarchical PVS is also described.
      </p>

      <p>To generate frontier sets in a terrain, we start with the biggest mutually-invisible quads surrounding each player. Then, we grow the
      frontiers along quads in the quad tree decomposition. For each quad added to the frontier, we merge its hierarchical PVS with the hierarchical PVS of the frontier. 
      We decide if we can add a quad by querying its visibility with respect to the other region's hierarchical PVS. The above picture shows an example of a frontier set
      grown in this fashion. The results are discussed in the <a href="http://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/5688/1/Avni_Shachar_201005_MSc.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a>.
